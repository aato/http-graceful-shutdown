## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
$ npm install http-graceful-shutdown
```

### Basic Usage

```js
var gracefulShutdown = require('http-graceful-shutdown');
...
server = app.listen(...);
...

// this enables the graceful shutdown
gracefulShutdown(server);
```


### Advanced Options

You can pass an options-object to specify your specific options for the graceful shutdown

The following example uses specifies all possible options (using more or less the default settings):

```js
const gracefulShutdown = require('http-graceful-shutdown');
...
server = app.listen(...);
...

// your personal cleanup function - this one takes one second to complete
function cleanup() {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
  	console.log('... in cleanup')
  	setTimeout(function() {
  		console.log('... cleanup finished');
  		resolve();
  	}, 1000)       
  });
}

// this enables the graceful shutdown with advanced options
gracefulShutdown(server,
	{
		signals: 'SIGINT SIGTERM',
		timeout: 30000,
		development: false,
		onShutdown: cleanup,
		finally: function() {
			console.log('Server gracefulls shutted down.....')
		}
	}
);
```

### Major (breaking) Changes - Version 2

- **renamed** option: `callback`: now to `finally`: place your (not time consuming) function, that will be handled at the end of the shutdown (not in dev-mode)
- **new** option: `onShutdown`: place your function, that will handle your additional cleanup things. Needs to return a promise

### Option Reference

| option         | default | Comments |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| signals | 'SIGINT SIGTERM' | define the signals, that should be handled (separated by SPACE) |
| timeout | 30000 | timeout till forced shutdown (in milli seconds) |
| development | false | if set to true, no graceful shutdown is proceeded to speed up dev-process |
| onShutdown | - | place your (not time consuming) callback function, that will handle your additional cleanup things. Needs to return a promise |
| finally | - | here you can place a small (not time consuming) function, that will be handled at the end of the shutdown (not in dev-mode) |

### Debug

If you want to get debug notes ([debug][debug-url] is a dependency of this module), just set the DEBUG environment variable to enable
 debugging:

```
export DEBUG=http-graeceful-shutdown
```

OR on Windows:

```
set DEBUG=http-graeceful-shutdown
```
